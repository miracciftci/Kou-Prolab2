Kocaeli University 2021-2022 programming laboratory 2 project

### Bank System
Within the scope of this project, we developed a mini-bank project with many features such as Depositing Money, Withdrawing Money, and Money Transfer. Admin Panel interface where users are authorized has been made. There are three separate entries: bank manager, bank employee and customer. Each separate entry has many specific jurisdictions. In the project, Java was used in the backend, Swing in the Interface, and MySQL for the DB.
